# Path of Exile - Inventory to Stash Auto Transfer Macro

This is an AutoHotkey script that lets you **auto-transfer all items** from your inventory into your stash in Path of Exile using `Ctrl + C`. It also ignores 2 slots at the bottom right and the one above for Portal scroll and Wisdom Scroll. Works on all display resolutions as you can set your own coordinates.
